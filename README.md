# TardigraTE

This is the repository for the code used for the paper "Teaching transposon classification as a means to crowd source the curation of repeat annotation â€“ a tardigrade perspective".

Here you can find the code used for practicals for the transposable element course (Physalia 2021) in the Practicals folder as well as the code used in the paper to produce the results, tables and figures (Manuscript folder).
